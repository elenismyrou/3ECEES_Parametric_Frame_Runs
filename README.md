# 3ECEES_Parametric_Frame_Runs

This repository contains OpenSeesPy input files for 4 8-storey RC frames, representing the collapsed buildings in Bayrakli, Izmir, Turkey. 
The structural properties are parametrically varied using the Bal et al., 2008 study :

"Bal IE, Crowley H, Pinho R. and Gulay FG. (2008), "Detailed assessment of structural characteristics of Turkish RC building stock for loss assessment models",
Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering.

The earthquake acceleration records are read from the folder GMfile and the results are composed as pkl (pickle) files and written into the Out folder.

IMPORTANT: All 4 input files produce outfput files with similar names and write into the same folder (Out). If you run them one after the other, the output files will be overwritten.
